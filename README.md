# HttpClient
HTTP is one of the most widely used protocols in the world. 
Almost every web application uses HTTP for communication.
In C#, HTTP requests are sent through HttpClients. 
Before sending any HTTP requests, the HttpClient needs to be initialized properly.

In this repository, typed HttpClient with delegate handler is implemented.
